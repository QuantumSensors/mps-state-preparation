# MPS State Preparation

This repository contains an implementation of our state preparation technique as described in [Phys. Rev. Applied 18, 024013](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.18.024013) ([arXiv:2110.13454](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13454))

The final output of our technique are the unitary matrices corresponding to gates on a quantum computer.

# Installation

The recommended way is to install via the pip tool.

```bash
pip install mpsprep
```

# Usage

Please see the [example.ipynb](docs/example.ipynb) notebook for some examples.
